# zmk_corne

This project would not be possible without the help of these people:

https://github.com/wj-zhe/Kretstrad
or most importantly:

This one helped me figure out the layout for the files i need to make the firmware compile. It is modified, but the core of this persons work is still there, so thanks.

But lets not forget the best layout for custom keyboards :)

This corne like build features a Xiao BLE controller and a custom designed board designed by me, but heavily inspired by the crkbd.
The wiring based on how the kiai split does it to keep both controllers up side but not use multiple pads like the older cornes or the helix

KiCad project is a redesigned corne choc, but everything is changed except the general outline. Files in this repository

I am currently waiting for the pcb to arrive, but i will post a picture once it arrives and i have tested everything.
I dont recommend ordering the pcb until i have tested it.
